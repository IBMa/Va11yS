        <!-- Component start -->
        <p>The following is an excerpt from the <cite>The Story of my Life</cite> by Helen Keller</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Even in the days before my teacher came, I used to feel along the square stiff boxwood
                hedges, and, guided by the sense of smell, would find the first violets and lilies.  
                There, too, after a fit of temper, I went to find comfort and to hide my hot face 
                in the cool leaves and grass.</p>
