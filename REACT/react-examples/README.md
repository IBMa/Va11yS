# React Examples
These React examples are a single page React application deployed on GitHub. It was created using [Create React App] (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 

To see the working demo, go to React Examples (https://snidersd.github.io/react-examples/#/).

Select the link in the left navigation pane of the demo to view the example for each element. Accessibility test results are also included at the bottom of each example.

To improve accessibility, the following packages have been added to the application:
The [react-helmet] (https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) package to manage the page title.
The [react-range] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-range) package to create the form slider.
[W3C WAI ARIA Landmarks] (https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_landmarks_to_identify_regions_of_a_page) to identify regions to a page.
