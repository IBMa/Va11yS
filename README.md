### Testable the accessibility of HTML &amp; ARIA samples

These code samples help developers and testers understand how different web components operate with assistive technology (AT) on desktop and mobile devices. They contain sample components along with testing results. When a new OS or AT is released, the data will be updated.

The best way to use these samples is to experiment with the component behaviors on different mobile devices or desktop environments. You can then "view source" to copy and modify the code for your own applications.

**Note:** The look and feel of these code samples is quite simplistic as the goal is to provide the cleanest view of the components being used without clutter.
